Steps to Follow:
Install Required Libraries: If you haven't already, install requests and BeautifulSoup using pip:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4
Update Selectors: The CSS selectors (e.g., .product, .product-name, .product-price, .product-rating) need to be updated according to the actual HTML structure of the target e-commerce website. You can inspect the website using browser developer tools to find the correct selectors.

Run the Program: Execute the script to scrape data and save it to a CSV file.

Handling Anti-Scraping Measures: Some websites have measures to prevent scraping (e.g., CAPTCHAs, IP blocking). Using headers, delays between requests, or more advanced techniques (e.g., using Selenium for dynamic content) can help bypass these measures.
